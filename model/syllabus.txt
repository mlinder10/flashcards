Course description: This course focuses on the physical, cognitive, social, and emotional
development across the human lifespan.
Prerequisites: PSYC 101 or EDPY 335 or SCHC 130
Required Course Materials:
6-month access to Achieve platform for the following text:
Fuligni, A. S., Fuligni, A. J., & Bayne, J. (2023). Scientific American: Lifespan Development
(1st ed.). Worth Publishers, Macmillan Learning.
If you are registered for this course, your tuition will be billed for the cost of Achieve (which
includes the e-book). The billed amount is the lowest price for these materials (cheaper
than Macmillan website and cheaper than buying materials separately).
Course Objectives:
1. 2. 3. 4. Students will gain an understanding of human development across the lifespan.
Students study key developmental theorists and theories and be able to compare
and contrast perspectives.
Students will identify eight stages of development, including prenatal development,
and describe physical, cognitive, social, and emotional development across stages.
Students will gain an understanding of factors, such as culture, genetics, and
environment, that impact development.Learning Outcomes:
After successful completion of this course, students will be able to:
1. Define developmental science and understand its historical origins
2. Describe different study designs and related ethical standards in research
3. Explain the contexts of family, community, country, and historical moment in
shaping development
4. Compare and contrast biological, psychodynamic, behaviorist, cognitive, and
cultural perspectives and related theories/theorists in developmental science
5. Describe the scientific method and ethical standards as they relate to
developmental research
6. Describe basic components of human genetics and explain the role of epigenetics
in development
7. Understand prenatal development, birth, and newborn developmental
characteristics
8. Explain the importance of familial relationships, interactions, and attachment in
infant development
9. Describe brain processes and neurological changes throughout the lifespan
10. Describe physical and cognitive maturation across the lifespan and related
developmental factors
11. Explain the importance of sense of self and identity formation in early childhood,
and changes to both throughout the lifespan
12. Discuss changes in relationships from early childhood through late adulthood
13. Describe moral development at different life stages
14. Evaluate representations of developmental science in media and use critical
thinking to compare these representations with academic sourcesCourse Delivery:
This course will be primarily in-person and lecture-based with opportunities for discussion
throughout meetings. We will cover a broad range of information over a relatively short
period of time. The course will also utilize digital resources and activities through the
Achieve platform.
Remote Learning Days are also incorporated in the class schedule. On these days,
students will access the pre-recorded lecture virtually via Blackboard at their convenience.
There will be no in-person lecture on Remote Learning Days.
A detailed schedule of content is provided at the end of the syllabus. While I will work to
follow this schedule closely, revisions to this schedule may be necessary due to
unforeseen circumstances. If changes are made to the schedule, you will be notified in
class, and a revised syllabus will be uploaded to Blackboard.
This course uses Achieve and Blackboard. Blackboard recommends using Firefox, Edge,
or Chrome browsers. It is also recommended to update Javascript and Adobe Reader for
the best online learning experience.
Course Assignments & Expectations:
• Reading Assignments: Each chapter will be reviewed across 2 class meetings (e.g.,
Ch. 3 is covered on 1/27 and 1/29). The detailed course schedule is included on the
last page of the syllabus.
• Learning Modules: In Blackboard, you will find “Learning Modules.” Students
should complete all material associated with the week’s topics. Materials in the
learning modules include lecture slides, video content, links to assignments,
additional readings, “to-do” lists, and more. It is essential that you complete each
learning module to do your best on quizzes, tests, reflections.
• Reflection Papers: You will submit 7 “reflections.” I will provide you with a prompt
and you will submit your response as an attached Word document. Reflections are
due by 11:59pm on Sundays. Late submissions will result in a 20-point penalty. A
detailed grading rubric, which describes all expectations, may be found on
Blackboard.
o Emphasized paper requirements:
▪ APA format
▪ Include at least 2 citations/references (also in APA format)
▪ Use academic language (e.g., no colloquial language)
▪ Demonstrate critical thinking
o You will not plagiarize. To deter plagiarism, submissions are randomly
submitted to SafeAssign. If plagiarism is detected, you will be reported to theOffice of Academic Integrity.
• Reading Quizzes: You will complete reading quizzes on Achieve for each chapter.
Each quiz consists of 20 randomly selected multiple-choice questions. You will
have 30 minutes to complete each quiz (one attempt, only). Your lowest quiz grade
will be dropped at the end of the semester.
• Concept Practice (CP): You will complete interactive tutorials that help to reinforce
concepts covered throughout the course. These assignments take approximately 5
minutes to complete and include concept review, practice, quiz (e.g., a couple of
questions), and conclusion. CP assignments are due by 11:59pm on Sundays,
however, you are strongly encouraged to complete these assignments as you
complete the chapters. Waiting to complete the assignments until Sunday will
result in several tasks being due at the same time. There will be 16 concept
practices throughout the course. Your lowest concept practice score will be
dropped at the end of the semester.
o Note: Achieve will automatically assign a grade after completion. However,
if I review your work and determine you answered questions insufficiently
(e.g. one-word response, verbatim responses from textbook), your grade will
change.
• Exams: There are 2 exams in this course: a midterm exam and a final exam. Each
exam consists of 65 multiple choice questions and is timed at 75 minutes. You may
attempt each exam 2x if you wish – the higher of the 2 scores will be recorded.
o Midterm: Parts 1-4 (Chapters 1-9)
o Final: Parts 5-8 (Chapters 10-17) *non-cumulative
• Extra Practice (optional): There are non-graded practice quizzes available for each
chapter. They are not required but are a great study tool to measure your
comprehension of material. These can be visited/revisited at any time.
Grading
Reading quizzes, the midterm, and final exam will be graded automatically, and you will be
able to review these assignments after the due date. Reflection papers will be graded
within 10 days of submission unless you are notified otherwise.
Final grades will be calculated using a weighted grading formula. The Blackboard
gradebook will display your weighted grade. If you’d like to double-check the grade
showing on Blackboard, you can calculate your overall course grade using a weighted
calculator.Grading Scale:
A = 89.5 – 100% C = 69.5 – 74.4%
B+ = 84.5 – 89.4% D+ = 64.5 – 69.4%
B = 79.5 – 84.4% D = 59.5 – 64.4%
C+ = 74.5 – 79.4% F = < 59.4%
Note: I do not “bump” final grades up at the end of the semester, regardless of how
close you are to the next letter grade.
Weighted Assignments:
Reading quizzes (avg. of 18 quizzes) 30%
Reflection papers (avg. of 7 submissions) 30%
Concept practice 10%
Midterm (chapters 1-9) 15%
Final (chapters 10-18) 15%
